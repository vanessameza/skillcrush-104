			<h4 class="vanessa-advice">Be patient with yourself!</h4>

			<p class="vanessa-advice">Learning to code isn't easy. The difficult times are the most enjoyable. Remember this is something you've never done before and that it takes time and practice, lots of practice to learn and get better at it.</p>

			<p class="vanessa-advice">Don't give up. Whatever you do, don't give up. I promise that with enough time and practice you will start to understand it and one day you'll be sitting at your desk with your laptop, late at night and you'll have your <strong>A-HA!</strong> moment. And in that moment all the coffee, sweat and tears will be worh it. Until then enjoy the journey.</p>
